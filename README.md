# Python-In-GIS
This Class project was based on the use of Python (Arcpy) to demonstrate the effect change atmospheric temperature has on flight altitude attained by eagle owls, by answering the question “What is the correlation between monthly mean temperature variation and movement behavior of male and female eagle owls in terms of flight height and how can we seek any visible pattern between the variations of these two variables?”. This was based on GPS Tracking data of 21 eagle owls was obtained from the Movebank online database of animal tracking. The 21 eagle owls’ data is located in Germany states of Nordrhein-Westfalen, Bayern, Hessen and Niedersachsen with most of the data located in Nordrhein-Westfalen. An ArcGIS Toolbox was generated to make the workflow automated and reproducible on similar data.
